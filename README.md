# CycleGan

This is my implementation of the Cycle GAN architecture proposed by Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola, Alexei A. Efros in their
paper titled 'Unpaired Image-to-Image translation using Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks'

* disc.py: Implementation of the discriminators
* gen.py: Implementation of the generators
* dataset.py: Implementation of the custom dataset class
* train.py: the file containing the training loop
